          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity (%) and Poverty(%)</h2>
          <p>Poverty is linked to obesity based on the data shown in the plot avobe. It has been previously suggested that individuals
            who live in impoverish regions have poor access to fresh and healthy food. Areas with high poverty rates are often defined as 
            "Food Deserts", implying dimish access to healthy and fresh food. </p>
 
          <p>Based on AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION ADA; 43% of households with incomes below the poverty line ($21,756) are food insecure
            (uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, sufficient food). Accordingly, 14% of U.S. counties have more than 1 in 5 individuals
            that use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The county-wide utility of the program, as expected, correlates with 
            county-wide poverty rates (r = 0.81). Thus, in many poverty-dense regions, people are in hunger and unable to access affordable healthy food,
            even when funds avail. The double-edged sword of hunger and poor availability of healthy food is, however, unlikely to be the only 
            reason as to why obesity tracks with poverty.</p>
